    <p><center>Once made, creamed corn can be stored in the refrigerator for at least three days. It can also be frozen for up to three months.</center></p>
    <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 ears corn, shucked (4 to 5 cups)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped shallots or yellow onions</li>
        <li>3/8 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup half and half Chopped fresh parsley, chives, or tarragon, for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to make</h2> 
    <ol>
        <li><h4>Remove the corn kernels:</h4></li>
        <p>Set an ear of corn on a cutting board, and working from the thick to the narrow end, cut off 2 rows of kernels. Turn and cut off 2 or 3 more rows. Continue in this way until all the kernels are off all the cobs.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, use a corn scraper. Set the cobs on a rimmed baking sheet to keep the kernels from flying all over the place when you remove the kernels.</p>
        <li><h4>Scrape the cob to release the creamy milk:</h4></li>
        <p>After you have removed the kernels, hold one cob over the pile of corn on the cutting board or baking sheet, and use the back of the knife to rub across it, going back and forth, to release the pulpy corn milk. Repeat with all the ears. The starchy liquid of the corn milk adds creaminess to the kernels.</p>
        <li><h4>Cook the corn:</h4></li>
        <p>In a large skillet over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the shallots or onions and cook, stirring often, for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the shallots soften but are not brown. Add the corn, corn milk, salt, pepper, and half and half.</p>
        <p>Cook, stirring often, for 5 minutes, or until the kernels are tender and the corn looks creamy and slightly thickened. If it seems dry, stir in more cream or water, 1 tablespoon at a time. Taste and add more salt and pepper, if you like.</p>
        <li><h4>Serve the corn:</h4></li>
        <p>Transfer to a serving bowl and serve hot, garnished with chopped herbs.</p>
